# Wilms Tumor Gene Expression Analysis

This project was part of my internship in computational biology, where I analyzed gene expression data from Wilms tumor samples.

## Tools & Languages
- Python
- Bash
- CSV data handling
- Data visualization

## Key Tasks
- Normalized raw gene expression data
- Compared primary vs recurrent tumor profiles
- Visualized differential expression patterns
- Used Bash scripting to manage data preprocessing

> *Note: Sample data has been removed or anonymized.*

## Status
Completed project. Shared here for demonstration purposes.
